My algorithm will be based on the linked list containing a structure called Galaxy.

The definition of the structure Galaxy is as follows:

typedef struct Galaxy_t {

   char name[7];

   int x;

   int y;

   int z;

   struct Galaxy_t *next;

} Galaxy;

 

The structure of my program will be as follows.

1. Open the FILE stream and iteratively read the data into the list of Galaxy structures until EOF.

*** Start the clock here.

2. Traverse the linked list and compute the Cartesian distance between each galaxy and the spaceship's coordinate.

3. If the distance is shorter, copy the data of the current galaxy to a record. If not, continue until you traverse all the Galaxy objects.

*** End the clock here.

4. Log the nearest Galaxy's data and the total time consumed.

 

The worst-case time complexity will be O(n).
