// 
// Function: A binary max heap and its operating functions.



Prompt:
Examine the program for the binary heap provided in the folder eclipse-workspace2-ucsc. Note that this is a min heap; the smallest item is at index 1. Modify this program to implement a max heap in which the largest item is stored at index 1. Add a method called deleteMax that removes the largest item from the heap. What is the running time for the insert and deleteMax operations?

Answer:
The time complexity for the insertion operation: O(logN)
The time complexity for the deleteMax operation: O(logN)
