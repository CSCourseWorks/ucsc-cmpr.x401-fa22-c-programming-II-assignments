// Function: A linked-list-based double-ended queue.



Prompt:

Write a program to implement a deque using a linked list so that the following operations are possible :
a. push(d, x): Insert item x on the front end of deque d.
b. pop(d): Removing the front item from deque d and returning it.
c. inject(d, x): Insert item x on the rare end of deque d.
d. eject(d): Remove the rear item from deque d and return it.
e. Write routines to support the deque that takes O(1) time per operation. Should you
use a singly linked or doubly linked list to implement the deque?
