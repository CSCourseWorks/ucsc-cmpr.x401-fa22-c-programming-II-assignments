Finding the lowest cost path with minimum layovers......
--------------------------------------------------------

Graph 1:
The lowest cost path: (destination) 4 <- 2 <- 1 <- 0 (origin)
The lowest cost: 14
The number of layovers: 3

Graph 2:
The lowest cost path: (destination) 4 <- 3 <- 0 (origin)
The lowest cost: 15
The number of layovers: 2

Graph 3:
The lowest cost path: (destination) 4 <- 2 (origin)
The lowest cost: 4
The number of layovers: 1

Graph 4:
The lowest cost path: (destination) 4 <- 1 (origin)
The lowest cost: 2
The number of layovers: 1

Graph 5:
