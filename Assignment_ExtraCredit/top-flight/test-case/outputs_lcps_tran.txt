Finding the lowest cost path passing the transit vertex......
-------------------------------------------------------------

Graph 1:
The lowest cost path: (destination) 4 <- 2 <- 1 <- 0 (origin)
The lowest cost: 14

Graph 2:
The lowest cost path: (destination) 4 <- 2 <- 1 <- 0 (origin)
The lowest cost: 15

Graph 3:
The lowest cost path: (destination) 4 <- 2 <- 1 <- 4 <- 2 (origin)
The lowest cost: 14

Graph 4:
The lowest cost path: (destination) 4 <- 1 (origin)
The lowest cost: 2

Graph 5:
The lowest cost path: (destination) 4 <- 2 <- 3 <- 1 <- 0 (origin)
